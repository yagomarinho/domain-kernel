# domain-kernel

This repository contains the **core domain principles and patterns** I use to model the domains I work with.

It serves as a reference for how I structure domain logic, define boundaries between modules, and maintain consistency across projects.  
The goal is to make domain decisions predictable, reusable, and easier to evolve over time.

## Philosophy

- Focus on **domain clarity** over technical complexity
- Maintain **well-defined boundaries** between modules
- Use patterns and conventions that support **long-term maintainability**
- Keep infrastructure, frameworks, and tooling separate from core domain logic

## How I use this repo

I use `domain-kernel` as the starting point for all domain modeling in my projects.  
It informs decisions like:

- Module structure and interactions
- Entity and value object modeling
- Aggregate and service responsibilities
- Domain-level validation and invariants

This repository is **personal and opinionated**, designed to reflect the way I approach domain-driven development rather than to be a generic library.

Nothing here is meant to dictate rules for others — it exists to **capture my conventions** and provide a consistent foundation for my work.
